# Dog_Breed_Classification
This repository shows the work done in an Udacity project where CNN layers and fully connected neural network with three hidden layers were used to learn the features necessary to distinguish between 133 dog breeds. Transfer learning with VGG16 pretrained network has resulted in a model with around 85% accuracy.
